# ShellBase

**Your one-stop cheatsheet API for command-line power tools.**

ShellBase is a modern, developer-friendly API and admin console that powers command-line cheatsheets for tools like `git`, `bash`, `docker`, and more — complete with an OpenAPI-like tester, markdown-based documentation, and Gemini AI-powered command help.

- 🧪 **Swagger-like API tester** baked into the admin console

- 🔍 **Search support** (local, fast, extensible)

## 🧠 Why ShellBase?

> _Because the command line is powerful — but remembering every flag, parameter, or obscure tool? That's what we're here for._

ShellBase helps developers become more productive without switching contexts, Googling every other minute, or digging through man pages.
